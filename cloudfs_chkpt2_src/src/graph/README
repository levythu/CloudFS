Instructions on how to generate cloud cost graph:
1. Install python package "matplotlib" on your host machine as you don't have sudo permission on VM.
2. Replace the s3-server/s3server.pyc with the new one.
3. Run "make test_3_*" and you will see s3server.log in the make directory.
4. Scp s3server.log to your host machine.
5. Run "python plot.py" in the same directory as s3server.log and you can get the cost graph "graph.png".
